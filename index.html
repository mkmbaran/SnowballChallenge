        Just because drinking water appears clear, does not guarantee it isn't contaminated.<br>
        Our product helps detect bacteria and pathogens even in crystal clear water sources.<br>
        We value health and safety, and want people around the globe to know if what they are drinking is safe or not<br>
        by developing a new chemical concoction to register the purity of water we have been made it possible<br>
        to discover whether or not your drinking water really is safe to drink.<br>
